#title Bolt Testing Helpers

Bolt includes a helper file so that you can simulate a current user,
thus allowing you to test controllers that require authentication or
authorization.

* Loading the Helper File

In your functional test file, require the =bolt/mocking= file:

<src lang="ruby">
require 'bolt/mocking'
</src>

* Simulating a Logged In User

In one of your test methods (usually in your =setup= method) set the
current user:

<src lang="ruby">
def setup
  @controller = MyController.new
  @controller.current_user = users(:sjobs)
  @request    = ActionController::TestRequest.new
  @response   = ActionController::TestResponse.new
end
</src>

To force a log-out set the current user to =nil=:

<src lang="ruby">
@controller.current_user = nil
</src>
