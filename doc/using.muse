* Using Bolt

Bolt comes with extensive API documentation.  To get started with
Bolt, build the API documentation and allow it to guide you to the
necessary classes.

** Building the Bolt API Documentation

A script is provided to help you build the API documentation.  From
within the =vendor/plugins/bolt= directory:

<example>
$ sh script/rdoc.sh
</example>

You can then open the =doc/rdoc/index.html= file.
