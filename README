= Bolt

Bolt is yet another authentication/authorization plugin for Ruby on
Rails, implemented as a Rails Engine.  It is a full service plugin,
providing models, controllers, and views.

Authentication and Authorization are both provided by the plugin.
There is also support for working with any loaded class for
authentication, making it easy to authenticate with an external source
such as LDAP.


== Status

Bolt is currently in early development.  Work should progress quickly,
however.  Until it is ready for production, you might want to look at
the Rauth plugin instead: http://pmade.com/svn/oss/rauth/trunk/


== Installation

Rails Engines needs to be installed into your Rails application.  You
can find out more about Rails Engines here: http://rails-engines.org/

Once you have Rails Engines installed, place Bolt into your
vendor/plugins directory as you would any other plugin.  Then follow
these steps:

1. Create migrations: script/generate plugin_migration
2. Migrate your database: rake db:migrate
3. Place this line in your routes file: map.from_plugin(:bolt)
4. Read the Bolt configuration


== Authenticating With an External Source

1. Write a class that looks like the Identity class
2. Set Bolt::Config.backend


== History

Bolt is a derivative of Peter Jones' Rauth plugin for Rails.


== Rauth Comparison

Since Bolt is derived from Rauth, it might be useful to compare the
two.  The biggest difference is that Bolt is a Rails Engine, whereas
Rauth is a traditional Rails plugin.

Bolt is also greatly simplified.  The bridge and account creator code
has been removed, and all configuration options have been moved to a
single class (Bolt::Config).

Rauth limited you to one role per person.  Bolt allows a single user
to belong to many roles.  This is more in-line with the Unix group
philosophy.


== Credits

The primary author and maintainer of Bolt is Peter Jones.  Bolt is an
open source project, and has thus has received help from many
developers:
